# Description:

Basic E-Commerce Platform

## Responsive Web Design

Mobile devices are an important part of everyday life. People want to be able to browse theinternet, and access the information they need, from their favorite devices without anyheadaches or second-guessing. Responsive web design automatically adapts a web store tothe mobile device that’s being used without distorting the view.

## Fast Page Loading

Online shoppers want convenience – and they won’t stick around if a page takes forever toload. The online shopping experience should be seamless and easy. If load time is too longor functionality is clunky, shoppers will be gone with a quick click of the mouse.

## Product Details

Online shopping can be a leap of faith – a shopper can’t physically pick up and feel merchandise before they buy, like they would in a brick and mortar store. But shoppers still want to familiarize themselves with what you have to offer.

Include informative features on product pages such as high-res photos; in-depth productdescriptions;


## Search and Filter

Some customers know precisely what they’re looking for – which is why it’s important toprovide them with a focused shopping approach with searching and filtering functionality. Asearch bar or box helps customers instantly locate what they need.

Other features such as search word auto-fill and searching by the most used words supportefficient searching. The ability to filter products by different attributes also helps to quicklynarrow down products to meet a customer’s desired criteria.

## Customer Reviews

Shoppers want to hear from real people about their product experiences to see if the productfits their desires and expectations. Build trust with your shoppers by posting customerproduct reviews on your site. And while positive reviews are helpful, don’t be afraid to postnegative reviews, too – your transparency creates credibility on the honesty of your brand.

## Powerful Shopping Cart

A shopping cart isn’t just a place for customers to store items pending checkout – it’sanother important touchpoint that can deliver additional conversion opportunities. Crossselling at checkout helps target customers more precisely with products they are likely to beinterested in based on the items already in their cart – which can in turn increase thepurchase total.

Total visibility into the products awaiting purchase and their costs (including shipping andsales tax) keeps customers aware, and decreases the likelihood of abandonment.

## Simple Checkout

Don’t let a complicated or lengthy checkout process make customers abandon theirshopping cart at the last minute. Fields that the customers can fill out by choice on the form(such as signing up for a newsletter); pre-filling forms; a progress bar for multiplesteps/pages; and the ability to store credit card information for repeat shoppers helps tominimize frustration.

## Visible Contact Info

The quicker you answer a customer’s question, the quicker they move forward with the purchase process. Prominently displaying your contact info on your store helps customers know where to turn for a quick resolution to their queries.
